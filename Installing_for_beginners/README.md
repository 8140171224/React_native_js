## Getting Started with this React Native Tutorial

    There are certain prerequisites that beginners will need to set up in order to develop for React Native.
    Since iOS was the first platform supported, and the one weâ€™re covering in this tutorial, we need macOS
    and Xcode, at least version 6.3. Node.js is also needed. What helps is installing Watchman through the
    Brew package manager with brew install watchman. While this is not necessarily needed, it helps when 
    dealing with a lot of files inside our React Native project.

## React Native: The Sanest Mobile Application Development Framework.

To install React Native, we simply need to install the React Native command-line application with 

    npm install -g react-native-cli
    
Calling the `react-native` command then helps us create a new React Native application. Running

    react-native init HelloWorld
    
creates a folder called `HelloWorld` in which the boilerplate code can be found.
